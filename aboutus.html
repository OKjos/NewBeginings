    <h2>Meet Our Pastor</h2>
    <p>Todd Meece was called to serve New Beginnings Ministries, in the summer of 2024. He has a love for God's people, and a desire to see the lost come to know Christ. Pastor Todd considers his preaching style to be "theologically practical", and hopes that the folks who come to NBM will have a deep love for God, and His Word. Todd has four children and five grandchildren. He holds degrees from Purdue University, Crown College, and Andersonville Theological Seminary.</p>
